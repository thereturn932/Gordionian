# Gordionian TV

GordionianTV is a community run production company project. Our aim is to let community decide for next movie and find potential movie makers. Also, by investing in movies created by GordionianTV community also can earn money.

### How GordionianTV works
<br />
* First genres for the next production is selected
* Then, an acceptance phase starts and continues for 3 three days. At the end of this phase if selected genres are rejected a new voting opens.
* After, genre voting ends a new time period starts for movie makers to make a short movie about current genre.
* At the end of the given time to movie makers a new voting period starts for winner. In this voting period voters can invest money into the movie.
* When movie selected at the end of the movie voting period, invested money is given to movie makers part by part with the control of DAO.
* When movie finished, it will be streamed on Gordionian Streaming Platform (No name for now). Streaming earning will be distrubuted to between movie makers, dev team and the investors of the movie. (Shares are not decided yet)
